Reddit Bots by [/u/SmBe19](http://www.reddit.com/u/SmBe19)

To run any of those bots you need:
 - Python
 - PRAW
 
In the source code of the bots you will find at the top the `USER CONFIGURATION` and sometimes the `BOT CONFIGURATION`. In the `USER CONFIGURATION` section you should fill out every variable as they describe detailed what and where the bot should do (e.g. User Name, Subreddit to operate in, duration of sleep). The `BOT CONFIGURATION` section defines variables that you don't really have to change, but if you really have to, they are there. They are mostly constants for the bot (e.g. Name of config files).
